# HabitApp
Simple habit tracking app. It tracks the habit's success rate in percents.

## About
This app is made for everyone who wants to keep track of his habit. Unlike many other app, this app does not track the streak of days. It rather counts the success rate of habit based on the days you manage to keep up with the habit and how many times you tap the "Oopsie" button. You tap the "Oopsie" button when you don't keep up with your habit. The app shows you the success rate in percents. You can also find stats in the app. The stats show you how many days you succeeded and how many times you tapped the "Oopsie" button.

## Framework
+ Ionic
+ ReactJS

## Release
You can find exported Android native project in this repo. The app is not published to Google Play. If you want to install this app as an Android app to your Android phone, you can do it easily with Android studio. You could also build IOS native project and do the same with an Iphone and Xcode.
I'm planning to make this app available as a PWA (Progressive Web App).
